<h1>Patterns: Tarot</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is a game about recognizing visual patterns. Players compete to see who can find a set of three matching cards as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Spotting the Patterns</h2>

<p>The image on each card is composed of 4 different elements:
<ul>
  <li>Foreground Object</li>
  <li>Number of Objects</li>
  <li>Midground Character</li>
  <li>Background/Border</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For each element, there are exactly three variations:
<ul>
  <li><b>Foreground Object</b>: The Cup, The Book, or The Sword</li>
  <li><b>Number of Objects</b>: 1, 3, or 6</li>
  <li><b>Midground Character</b>: Mother Nature, Father Time, or Death</li>
  <li><b>Background/Border</b>: The Garden (white border), The Cosmos (black border), or The Sea (blue border)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each of the 81 cards in the deck is a unique combination of these elements.</p>

<p>A set is made by spotting three cards in which each element is either all different or all the same. For example, the three cards below form a set because they share the same background/border and character, and they have all different objects and all different object quantities.</p>

<div><img src="./qr-v1-good-set.jpg"/></div>

<p>In contrast, the cards below do not form a set because, while they have all different backgrounds, and the object and quantity are all the same, the characters are not all different (Death appears twice).</p>

<div><img src="./qr-v1-not-a-set.jpg"/></div>

<p>Death would either need to appear three times (all the same) or one time (all different) for these cards to make a valid set.</p>

<p>Spotting patterns and finding sets can be difficult, but this is the skill of the game and it gets easier the more you play!</p>

<p>One important tip is that, for any two cards, there is always exactly one other card in the deck that perfectly completes the set. Being able to quickly predict what that card would be and check to see if it's in play is a good skill to hone.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è: Unlike playing cards, Patterns cards <i><b>do</b> have an orientation</i>, which can be seen on both the front and back of the card. It's ok if some players have the cards facing away from them but <b>it is important that all cards are put into play with a consistent orientation</b>. To ensure this, be mindful of the orientation when shuffling. If an upsidedown card is spotted while dealing, simply rotate the card to match the others in play.</p>

<p>To begin with, shuffle the deck, taking care to preserve card orientation. One player is designated the dealer and, when everyone is ready, deals out six cards in two rows of three. This begins to form what is known as "the pool." Everyone examines these cards to try and find a set of three.</p>

<p>üìù NOTE üìù: Many times, the first six cards will not contain a valid set, but sometimes they <i>will</i>, so look carefully!</p>

<p>Any time someone sees a set, they should call out "Set!" then take the three cards out of the pool and place them face down in their personal score stack. Each set is worth three points and keeping the cards is how you keep score. In the event someone calls "Set!" and the cards do not actually form a set OR if someone touches cards without first saying "Set!" then they lose one point. Remove one card from their score stack and place it to the side out of play. If they don't have any cards in their score stack, then boop them lightly on the nose, say "Bad!" and continue play.</p>

<p>After a set has been scored, the dealer replaces the theee cards that were removed from the pool with three new cards from the deck.</p>

<p>If everyone agrees there is no set contained in the pool, then it's time to grow the pool. To do this, the dealer deals two additional cards to the pool (adding one to each row). If there's one card left, simply deal the remaining card and continue. If there are no cards left then the game is over and whoever has the most cards in their score stack is the winner!</p>

<p>üìù NOTE üìù: Once the pool has grown, it never shrinks back; just keep replacing cards when sets are found until there are no more cards in the deck.</p>
