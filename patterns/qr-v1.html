<h1>Patterns: Tarot ‚Äî Rulebook</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This is a game about recognizing visual patterns within a group of cards in play. Players compete to see who can find a set of 3 matching cards within the pool as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Spotting the Patterns</h2>

<p>The image on each card is composed of 4 different scene elements:
<ul>
  <li>Foreground Object</li>
  <li>Number of Objects</li>
  <li>Midground Character</li>
  <li>Background / Border</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For each scene element, there are exactly three variations:
<ul>
  <li><b>Foreground Object</b>: The Cup, The Book, or The Sword</li>
  <li><b>Number of Objects</b>: 1, 3, or 6</li>
  <li><b>Midground Character</b>: Mother Nature, Father Time, or Death</li>
  <li><b>Background / Border</b>: The Garden, The Cosmos, or The Sea</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each card in the deck is a unique combination of one variation from each element. Together these form 81 unique combinations / cards.</p>

<p>A set is made by spotting 3 cards in which each element is either all different or all the same. For example, the 3 cards below would form a set because they share the same background and character and they have all different objects and all different object quantities.</p>

((Example of a pattern))

<p>In contrast, the cards below would not form a set because, while they have all different backgrounds, and the object and quantity are all the same, the character Death is represented twice.</p>

((Example of not a pattern))

<p>Death would either need to appear 3 times (all the same) or 1 time (all different) for these cards to make a valid set.</p>

<p>Spotting patterns and finding sets can be difficult but this is the skill of the game and you may find it gets easier quickly as you become more familiar with the deck's theme.</p>

<p>One important tip is that, for any two cards, there is always exactly one other card in the deck that would perfectly complete a set. Being able to quickly predict what that would be and check to see if it's in play is a good skill to hone.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è: Unlike playing cards, patterns cards <i><b>do</b> have an orientation</i> which can be seen on both the front and back of the card. It's ok if some players have the cards facing away from them but <b>it's is important to ensure all cards are put into play with a consistent orientation</b>. The easiest way to ensure this is to be mindful of the orientation when shuffling (so they stay consistent). However, if an upsidedown card back is spotted while dealing, simply rotate the card as you place it down.</p>

<p>To begin with, shuffle the deck, taking care to preserve card orientation if possible. One player is designated the dealer and, when everyone is ready, deals out four cards in two rows of two. This begins to form what is known as "the pool". Everyone has a chance to examine these cards to see if any three of them form a set.</p>

<p>üìù NOTE üìù: Most of the time, these first random cards will not form a set, but sometimes they <i>will</i>, so look carefully!</p>

<p>Any time someone sees a set, they should call out "Set!", then take the three cards out of the pool and place them face down in their personal score stack. Each set is worth 3 points and keeping the cards is how you keep score. In the event someone calls "Set!" and the cards do not actually form a set OR if someone touches cards without first saying "Set!" then they lose one point. Remove one card from their score stack and place it to the side out of play. If they don't have any cards in their score stack, then boop them lightly on the nose, say "bad!", and continue play.</p>

<p>After a set has been scored, the dealer replaces the theee cards that were removed from the pool with three new cards from the deck.</p>

<p>If everyone agrees there is no set possible in the pool, then it's time to grow the pool. To do this, the dealer deals two additional cards to the pool (one on each row). If there's one card left, simply deal the remaining card and continue. If there are no cards left then the game is over and whoever has the most cards in their score stack is the winner!</p>

<p>üìù NOTE üìù: Once the pool has grown, it never shrinks back, just keep replacing cards when sets are found until there are no more cards in the deck.</p>
